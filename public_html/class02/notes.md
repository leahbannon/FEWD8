```sh
<hr> = horizontal rule
<div>
```

### Image paths

Relative path -> no / "images/logo.png"
Inside webroot, a relative path could be used
Absolute path -> includes / and sends computer to top level "/images/logo.png"
Why would you use relative or absolute path? Absolute paths will break if you run it locally.
